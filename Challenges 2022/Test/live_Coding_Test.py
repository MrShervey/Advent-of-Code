# We want to create a program that:
# Takes three integers as inputs
# If the sum of the first and last numbers are greater than the second number then the second number is 
# subtracted from the third
# If not then then the sum of all three are calculated
# Return the result
# Multiply the result by the first number
# Print the value calculated

# Use three subroutines, and input validation
